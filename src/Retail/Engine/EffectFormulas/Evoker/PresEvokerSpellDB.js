// This is the Evoker spell database. 
// It contains information on every spell used in a sequence. Each spell is an array which means you can include multiple effects to code spells like Echo that are both a heal,
// and a buff. 
// Any errors can be reported on the QE github, or to me directly on discord @Voulk1858.
// The spell database can be copied locally to a function and then individual spells edited for talents, tier sets and so on.

// - Available Fields -
// type: damage (effect deals damage), heal (effect heals), buff (effect adds a buff), function (spell runs a custom function).
// cost: mana cost. This is a percentage of base mana, not the raw mana cost. The true mana spend should be cost x baseMana / 100.
// coeff: the spells intellect scaling. This is a combination of base coefficient, any possible spell ranks, and any relevant auras that might impact the spell.
// cooldown: a spells cooldown. 
// expectedOverheal: A healing spells typical overhealing percentage. We'll pull this from logs when we can, but they're estimates for now. Can be turned off completely.
// secondaries: The secondary stats a spell scales with. Note that HoTs that scale with haste should use the hasteScaling flag instead of including it as a secondary.
// targets: The number of targets a spell hits. All effects will be applied to every target. If missing then defaults to 1.
// tags: optional tags for specific functionality. Also includes scaling modifiers like spells that have square root scaling with number of targets.

// Buff spells also expect the following:
// buffDuration: How long the buff lasts
// buffType: 'stats' / 'statmult' / 'special' / 'function'. 
// stat: stat buff types should include which stat it gives you. Bell for example would add 'mastery'.
// value: stat buff types should also have a value showing how much stat it gives you. When this is variable (like a trinket) then it can be fed into the ramp functions directly and
// Any trinket values displayed in this DB are placeholders only and are replaced when simulated.

// For spells with aura effects, include it in the coefficient itself. Aura effects that buff the entire spec are handled in EVOKERCONST.
